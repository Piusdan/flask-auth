## flask-api-auth
An authetication service built in flask 
- implements 
    - token auth
    - outh2 auth
    - username-password auth
    - many more coming

## From scratch are we in '96?
Built this an attempt to understand autheticating APIs using Python-Flask. <br>
This is meant to be a fully fledged auth service that you can plug into your project and get working

## Conventions used
* pep8 

## What I want to achieve
Provide an elaborate, robust and extendable authetication template for your project, so that you can set out to build things that matter
